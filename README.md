# 👶 Baby Tracker

A minimalist yet mighty desktop app to track your baby's day-to-day growth, nourishment, sleep patterns, and the noble chronicles of Susu-Poty. Built in Go using the [Fyne](https://fyne.io) GUI toolkit, this app is designed with care—from **Feeds to Sleep to Growth** and everything in between.

Whether you're a caregiver, parent, or curious builder, this project aims to balance usability with technical learning—while keeping things fun and purpose-driven.

## 💡 Why This Project?
Because caregiving deserves clean tools. Because learning Go should be hands-on. And because nothing says “I’m a full-stack developer” like tracking both baby food and baby poop in the same GUI.
